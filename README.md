# ML-Project
Machine Learning Project for School Resource Allocations.
Given various student data collected from two Portuguese schools with students from 15-22 years old, a machine learning model will be created to predict a student's performance based on select attributes. This model will be used to identify students that could benefit from additional assistance and interventions to improve their grade in the course.
